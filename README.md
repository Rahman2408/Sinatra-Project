# A Task @ A Time

##Objective
    -Provide a subtle, non-overbearing, way for a user to track whatever tasks they deem important enough to give their attention to. It can also be the exact opposite if one wanted to use it as list of long-term goals to provide themselves with over time.

##Description
    -This sinatra-based web app is called "A Task @ A Time" and is ultimately a way for a user to add and track the To-Do's they choose to do over a timespan of their choice. Most people suggest to write things down, while others are very familiar with apps that have a boatload of features which can be a little intimidating and eventually demotivating. Personally, I'd like to start storing self-reminders somewhere other than my brain without it require a half-day crash course how to do so. While mentioning the factor of motivation, a user's completed tasks are still there to keep whether to admire the self-accomplishments, or to re-use the task in the future. The intention of "A Task @ A Time" was hopefully a middle-ground between an easily lost piece of paper, and an app / interface that's simply overly-complex for general to-do list.

##Instructions

1. Fork and clone the repository.

2. Run 'bundle install' in your terminal.

3. Run 'rake db:migrate' in your terminal migrate from ActiveRecord, create the data   tables.

4. Lastly, run 'shotgun' in your and vist "localhost:9393" in your browser, or alternatively, run 'rackup config.ru' in your terminal and visit "localhost:9292" in your browser. Either works but the important detail is the to look for the PORT number value. That is the number that should go after "localhost: " in your browser.

5. If done correctly you should be viewing and have full access to "A Task @ A Time" and all of it's features. 

6. Whenenver finished, just press "ctrl + c" while in your terminal before exiting out and the server should stop. 

7. Most important of all: Enjoy!
